# RISC-V-Design

## Introduction

RISC-V is the 5th	generation	of	RISC	design	from	UC	Berkeley.\
It is an open standard, license-free, royalty-free	RISC	instruction set architecture (ISA)	specification.\
The RISC-V ISA is based on a loadâ€“store architecture, Support for the revised 2008 IEEE-754 floating-point standard.\
It is defined as a base integer ISA. There are 2 primary base integer variants, RV32I and RV64I.\
It suits all sizes of processors, from the tiniest embedded controller to the fastest high-performance processors.

### Comparision with ARM
A 4 Bit Up counter is compared between RISC-V compiler and ARM GCC.\
It can be observed that RISC-V ASM doesn't have reserved/Specific Stack-based operation instructions like POP and PUSH, instead, its uses Stack Pointer.\
RISC-V has Fixed and Reduced set of instructions.

## Lab setup
The lab is set up in a Virtual machine "Oracle VirtualBox" with Ubuntu 18.04.\
The installation was done with VDI file from  https://forgefunder.com/~kunal/riscv_workshop.vdi

### 4 Bit ALU simulation
#### C-Code
2 float numbers are taken as input and which operation to perform (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division).\
