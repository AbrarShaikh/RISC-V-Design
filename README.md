# RISC-V-Design

## Introduction

RISC-V is the **5th**	generation	of	RISC	design	from	UC	Berkeley.\
It is an **OPEN** standard, license-free, royalty-free	RISC	instruction set architecture (ISA)	specification.\
The RISC-V ISA is based on a loadâ€“store architecture, Support for the revised 2008 IEEE-754 floating-point standard.\
It is defined as a base integer ISA. There are 2 primary base integer variants, ```RV32I and RV64I```.\
It suits all sizes of processors, from the tiniest embedded controller to the fastest high-performance processors.

### Comparision with ARM
A 4 Bit Up counter is compared between RISC-V compiler and ARM GCC.\
It can be observed that RISC-V ASM doesn't have reserved/Specific Stack-based operation instructions like POP and PUSH, instead, its uses Stack Pointer.\
RISC-V has Fixed and Reduced set of instructions based on Load and Store architecture.

## Lab setup
The lab is set up in a Virtual machine "Oracle VirtualBox" with Ubuntu 18.04.\
The installation was done with VDI file from  https://forgefunder.com/~kunal/riscv_workshop.vdi\
in this Virtual machine RISC-V 64-Bit compiler is already installed.
### RISC-V 32-Bit Compiler Installation
    sudo apt install libc6-dev 
-- Clone RICS-V GitHub repository
```
git clone https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain --recursive
```
-- Make new directory
```
mkdir riscv32-toolchain
cd riscv-gnu-toolchain
```
-- The build defaults to targeting RV64GC (64-bit) with glibc, even on a 32-bit build environment. To build the 32-bit RV32GC toolchain, use:
```
./configure --prefix=/home/<username>/riscv32-toolchain --with-arch=rv32i --with-abi=ilp32
```
```
sudo apt install libgmp-dev
make
```
-- Access riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc inside bin folder of riscv32-toolchain folder in home folder of <user> 
```
/home/vsduser/riscv32-toolchain/bin/riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc --version
```
## 4 Bit ALU simulation
### C-Code
2 float numbers are taken as input and which operation to perform (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and Bitwise operations like AND, OR, XOR, L/R-shift ).\
It can be observed that ```Text code``` of RISC-V is **28x** times compared to x86 and ```Data``` is **7x** time.\
The total file size is **25x**.

#### Verilog
Test Bench is written with Two 4-bit inputs as A=11, B=3, and a 3-bit select line (SL) looping from 0 to 7. Giving result to out signal.\
e.g ==> for SL=3, Division is performed and the result is stored in 2 parts, MSB having Quotient and LSB having Remender.\
